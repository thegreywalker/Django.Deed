## Url's
- And Url is a mapping technique which generally loads different actions for different motive. For exmaple,
    - fstx.com/         -->     Index Page.
    - fstx.com/posts    -->     Show lists of all posts.
    - fstx.com/posts/p1 -->     Shows an individual posts of all the posts.

## Views
- A View is an action which is executed in reference to a specific Url. So, when we navigate to an Url it triggers a View which further triggers a function which does the job of displaying data, prepare any HTML Page or any other related task.
